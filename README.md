# 42 School Projects

This repository contains various projects completed during the academic journey at 42 School of Paris. Each project covers different programming concepts and challenges. Below is a brief description of each project:

## c_pool
Introduction to C programming language. This project focuses on familiarizing students with C syntax, data types, loops, and basic algorithms.

## cpp_pool
Introduction to C++ programming language. This project aims to teach C++ concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and basic object-oriented programming principles.

## cub3d
A graphic design project that involves creating a simple 3D game using the raycasting technique. The project helps improve skills in working with windows, colors, events, and shape filling. It also explores mathematical applications in algorithms.

## ft_containers
An implementation of C++ standard template library containers. The project requires implementing vector, map, and stack, along with related components like iterators, enable_if, and other standard library features.

## ft_irc
An IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server implementation in C++ 98, based on RFC 1459. The project involves handling client connections and messages but doesn't include server-to-server communication.

## ft_printf
A re-implementation of the printf function in C. The project focuses on understanding formatting and handling various data types.

## ft_transcendence
A web application that allows users to play Pong with each other, create chat channels, and interact in real-time. The app is built using NestJS for the backend, VueJS 3 for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

## get_next_line
A function to read text lines from a file descriptor one at a time. The function reads until a newline character is encountered and returns the line or NULL if there is nothing more to read or an error occurs.

## inception
A system administration project where students set up a small infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. The setup includes NGINX with TLS, WordPress with PHP-FPM, and a MariaDB database.

## libasm
Recreation of some standard C library functions in assembly language. Functions like strlen, strcpy, strcmp, write, read, strdup, and others are implemented in assembly. It also contains functions for linked list manipulation.

## libft
A library containing re-implemented libc functions and additional utility functions. The library includes functions like isalpha, isdigit, memset, memcpy, strchr, strlcpy, atoi, and more. It also contains functions for linked list manipulation.

## minishell
A simple shell implementation with basic functionalities like displaying a prompt, handling history, executing commands, interpreting quotes and special characters, implementing redirections, pipes, and environment variables.

## philosophers
A solution to the dining philosophers problem using multithreading in C. The project focuses on synchronization and thread management.

## pipex
A program that simulates shell pipes in C. It reads input from a file, executes two commands on the data, and writes the output to another file.

## push_swap
A sorting project that involves manipulating data on a stack using a limited set of instructions. The challenge is to find the most efficient solution for sorting the data with the fewest actions.
